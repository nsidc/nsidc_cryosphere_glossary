name,Description
zone of gas-hydrate stability,that portion of the subsurface where the conditions of temperature and pressure are suitable for the formation and preservation of gas hydrates.
ablation,"(1) combined processes (such as sublimation, fusion or melting, evaporation) which remove snow or ice from the surface of a glacier or from a snow-field; also used to express the quantity lost by these processes (2) reduction of the water equivalent of a snow cover by melting, evaporation, wind and avalanches."
ablation area,the area of a glacier where more glacier mass is lost than gained.
ablation hollows,"depressions in the snow surface caused by the sun or warm, gusty wind."
band ogives,alternate bands of light and dark on a glacier; usually found below steep narrow icefalls and thought to be the result of different flow and ablation rates between summer and winter.
calving glacier,"glacier that loses material by calving, usually a glacier that terminates in sea, lake, or river water."
