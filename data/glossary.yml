sastrugi: |
  Erosional features that are formed when wind-entrained particles
  carve hardened, wind-packed snow on sea ice, glaciers and land.
  Sastrugi are parallel to the prevailing wind direction have steep
  slopes facing the wind and gentle slopes that stretch downwind.
  These features have been used to map wind directions in Antartica.
  Intersection of satrugi create sharp edges that appear as grooves,
  scallops and flutes.  Typically, satrugi are between 0.3 and 0.5 m
  high.  Similar features are found in warm deserts, where they are
  are caled "yardangs".

barchan dunes: |
  Crescent shaped mounds with a tail directed upwind and two horns
  pointing downwind.  Barchans form in sand as well as snow.  Snow
  barchans are typically 3 to 20 m long, 5 to 12 m wide and 0.1 to 0.5
  m high.  Most observations of barchans have been reported for
  Antarctica and Greenland.  They tend to form when new snow is
  transported by moderate winds (8 to 20 m/s).

whaleback dunes: |
  Elongated domes, parallel to each other, that form parallel to the
  wind.  Typically, they are 20 to 50 m long, 1 to 3 m wide and 0.3 to
  0.5 m high.  Whaleback dunes tend to form in wind speeds greater
  than 15 m/s.  Most published descriptions come from Antarctica but
  whaleback dunes have been observed at Summit Station, Greenland, and
  also in the Arctic.  The Inupiaq call them "qimuagruk", which means
  whaleback.

ripple marks: |

crag and tails: |

pits: |
  small dimples or cup-shaped depressions in the snow surface
  that tend to have a steeper downwind slope than the upwind slope.
  Pits typically form where there is a thin snow crust that is
  slightly harder than the underlying snow.
