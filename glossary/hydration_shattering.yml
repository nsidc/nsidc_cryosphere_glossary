term: hydration shattering
definition:
  1: A form of weathering that affects all rocks; water freezes in pores and cracks,
    which leads to an increase in specific volume (vol/unit mass) of the water, producing
    stress that is greater than the tensile strength of all common rocks; ultimately
    leads to shattering and fracturing of the rocks.
