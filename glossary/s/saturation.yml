term: saturation
definition:
  1: The condition in which the partial pressure of any fluid constituent (water in
    the atmospheric air) is equal to its maximum possible partial pressure under the
    existing environmental conditions, such that any increase in the amount of that
    constituent will initiate within it a change to a more condensed state; evaporation
    ceases under such conditions.
