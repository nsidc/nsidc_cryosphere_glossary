term: stratus
definition:
  1: A principal low-level cloud type (cloud genus) in the form of a low-altitude,
    light to dark gray cloud layer with a rather uniform base; generally diffuse and
    dull; this cloud formation has little structure and looks like fog, except that
    it is above the ground, stratus does not usually produce precipitation, but when
    it does occur, it is in the form of minute particles, such as drizzle, ice crystals,
    or fine snow grains.
