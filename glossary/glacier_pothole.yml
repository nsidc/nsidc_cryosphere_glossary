term: glacier pothole
definition:
  1: Potholes formed at the bottom of glaciers through erosion caused by sand and
    gravel in melt-water; melt-water seeps through crevasses in the glaciers, sometimes
    forming whirpools; at the bottom of the glacier, the water is under very high
    pressure, leading to erosion of underlying rocks.
