term: arctic oscillation
definition:
  1: An atmospheric circulation pattern in which the atmospheric pressure over the
    polar regions varies in opposition with that over middle latitudes (about 45 degrees
    n) on time scales ranging from weeks to decades; the oscillation extends through
    the depth of the troposphere, and from january to march, it extends upward into
    the stratosphere where it modulates in the strength of the westerly vortex that
    encircles the arctic polar cap region; the north atlantic oscillation and arctic
    oscillation are different ways of describing the same phenomenon.
