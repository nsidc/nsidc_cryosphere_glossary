term: anemometer
definition:
  1: An instrument which measures wind speed or wind speed and direction; a cup anemometer
    measures the wind speed from the speed of rotation of a windmill which consist
    of 3 or 4 hemispherical or conical cups, each fixed to the ends of horizontal
    arms attached to a vertical axis; a byram anemometer is a variety of the cup anemometer;
    a counting anemometer has cups or a fan whose rotation is transmitted to a technical
    counter which integrates directly the air movement speed; a hand anemometer is
    small portable anemometer held at arm's length by an observer making a wind speed
    measurement; a pressure tube anemometer (dines anemometer) is an instrument which
    derives wind speed from measurements of the dynamic wind pressures - wind blowing
    into a tube develops a pressure greater than the static pressure, while wind blowing
    across a tube develops a pressure less than the static, this pressure difference
    is proportional to the square of the wind speed.
