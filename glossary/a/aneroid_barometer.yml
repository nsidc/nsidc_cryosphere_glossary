term: aneroid barometer
definition:
  1: 'An instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure; it is constructed on the following
    principles: an aneroid capsule (vidie capsule, which is a thin, disk-shaped box
    or capsule, usually metallic) is partially evacuated of gas, and is restrained
    from collapsing by an external or internal spring; the deflection of the spring
    will be nearly proportional to the difference between the internal and external
    pressures; magnification of the spring deflection is obtained both by connecting
    capsules in series and by mechanical linkages.'
