term: emissivity
definition:
  1: The amount of electromagnetic energy (primarily at wavelengths longer than 1.0
    micrometer) that an object emits; for example, the earth emits longwave radiation
    primarily in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but also in longer
    microwave wavelengths; the emissivity of an object varies as the fourth power
    of its absolute temperature.
