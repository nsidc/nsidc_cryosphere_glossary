term: haze
definition:
  1: Fine dust or salt particles dispersed through a portion of the atmosphere; the
    particles are so small that they cannot be felt or individually seen with the
    naked eye, but they diminish horizontal visibility and give the atmosphere a characteristic
    opalescent appearance that subdues all colors; a type of lithometeor.
