term: climate change
definition:
  1: A study dealing with variations in climate on many different time scales from
    decades to millions of years, and the possible causes of such variations;.
  2: In the most general sense, the term climate change encompasses all forms of climatic
    inconstancy (that is, any differences between long-term statistics of the meteorological
    elements calculated for different periods but relating to the same area) regardless
    of their statistical nature or physical causes; climate change may result from
    such factors as changes in solar activity, long-period changes in the earth's
    orbital elements (eccentricity, obliquity of the ecliptic, precession of equinoxes),
    natural internal processes of the climate system, or anthropogenic forcing (for
    example, increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
    gases).
  3: The term climate change is often used in a more restricted sense, to denote a
    significant change (such as a change having important economic, environmental
    and social effects) in the mean values of a meteorological element (in particular
    temperature or amount of precipitation) in the course of a certain period of time,
    where the means are taken over periods of the order of a decade or longer.
