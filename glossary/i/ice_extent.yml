term: ice extent
definition:
  1: The total area covered by some amount of ice, including open water between ice
    floes; ice extent is typically reported in square kilometers. extent defines a
    region as either ""ice-covered"" or ""not ice-covered."" a threshold determines
    this labeling. a typical threshold is 15 percent, meaning that if the data cell
    has greater than 15 percent ice concentration, the cell is labeled as ""ice-covered.""
    sea ice index products have a threshold of 15 percent. a threshold can also be
    as high as 30 percent.
