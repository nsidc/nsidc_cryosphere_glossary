term: ice skylight
definition:
  1: From the point of view of the submariner, thin places in the ice canopy, usually
    less than 1 meter (3.3 feet) thick and appearing from below as relatively light,
    translucent patches in dark surroundings; the under-surface of an ice skylight
    is normally flat; ice skylights are called large if big enough for a submarine
    to attempt to surface through them (120 meters, 131 yards), or small if not.
