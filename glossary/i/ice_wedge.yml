term: ice wedge
definition:
  1: Narrow ice mass that is 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet) wide at the ground surface,
    and extends as much as 10 meters (33 feet) down; a decrease in temperature during
    the winter leads to ice wedge cracks in the ground around ice wedges; during the
    summer, these cracks accumulate melt-water and sediment, forming pseudomorphs.
