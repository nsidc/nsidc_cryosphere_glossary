term: hoarfrost
definition:
  1: A deposit of interlocking ice crystals (hoar crystals) formed by direct sublimation
    on objects, usually those of small diameter freely exposed to the air, such as
    tree branches, plant stems and leaf edges, wires, poles, etc.; the surfaces of
    these objects are sufficiently cooled, mostly by nocturnal radiation, to cause
    the direct sublimation of the water vapor contained in the ambient air.
