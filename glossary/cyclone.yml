term: cyclone
definition:
  1: Area in the atmosphere in which the pressures are lower than those of the surrounding
    region at the same level; it is represented on a synoptic chart by a system of
    isobars at a specified altitude level (or a system of contours at a specified
    pressure level) which enclose relatively low values of pressure (or altitude);
    a cyclone begins when a wave (young) cyclone forms and moves along a front; a
    mature cyclone has well-developed warm sectors and both cold and warm fronts;
    an occluded cyclone is that within which there has developed an occluded front.
