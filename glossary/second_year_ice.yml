term: second-year ice
definition:
  1: Sea ice which has not melted in the first summer of its existence; by the end
    of the second winter, it attains a thickness of 2 meters (6.6 feet) or more; it
    stands higher out of the water than first-year ice; summer melting has somewhat
    smoothed and rounded the hummocks, which accentuation of minor relief by differential
    melting may have caused others to develop; bare patches and puddles are usually
    greenish-blue.
