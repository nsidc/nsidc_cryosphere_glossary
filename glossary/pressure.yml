term: pressure
definition:
  1: A type of stress characterized by uniformity in all directions; in dynamics,
    it is that part of the stress tensor that is independent of viscosity and depends
    only upon the molecular motion appropriate to the local temperature and density;
    it is the negative of the mean of the three normal stresses, and is, therefore,
    a scalar quantity expressed in units of force per unit area; in meteorology, commonly
    used for atmospheric pressure.
