term: ozone
definition:
  1: A nearly colorless (but faintly blue) gaseous form of oxygen, with a characteristic
    odor like chlorine; has a formula of o3 and a molecular weight of 48; found in
    trace quantities in the earth's atmosphere at all times, primarily in the stratosphere
    between heights of about 10 to 50 kilometers (6 to 31 miles; the ozonosphere or
    ozone shield) where its production results from photochemical processes involving
    ultraviolet radiation; its maximum concentration occurs between 20 to 25 kilometers
    (12 to 16 miles); in the lower atmosphere, ozone is commonly formed as a product
    of electrical discharges through the air.
