term: cyclone movement
definition:
  1: The spatial displacement of a center of low pressure caused by the local redistribution
    of mass in the atmosphere; the trajectory of the center is often altered by heating
    or cooling on the air column, which can result from thermal fluxes at the surface
    or latent heat transformations associated with cloud formation and precipitation;
    these processes change the temperature distribution in the air column, resulting
    in density changes which modify the surface pressures.
