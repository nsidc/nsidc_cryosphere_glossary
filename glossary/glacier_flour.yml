term: glacier flour
definition:
  1: A fine powder of silt- and clay-sized particles that a glacier creates as its
    rock-laden ice scrapes over bedrock; usually flushed out in meltwater streams
    and causes water to look powdery gray; lakes and oceans that fill with glacier
    flour may develop a banded appearance; also called rock flour.
