term: Beaufort Gyre
definition:
  1: An ocean and ice circulation pattern in the beaufort sea, north of alaska. this
    gyre moves in a clockwise direction, fed by an average high-pressure system that
    fosters anti-cyclonic winds. ice that forms in or drifts into the beaufort gyre
    has historically remained in the arctic ice system for years, accumulating snow
    and thickening each winter. beginning in the late 1990s, the ice began melting
    away while in the southern parts of the gyre, before completing the circulation.
