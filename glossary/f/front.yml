term: front
definition:
  1: In meteorology, generally, the interface or transition zone between two air masses
    of different density; since the temperature distribution is the most important
    regulator of the atmosphere density, a front almost invariably separates air masses
    of different temperature; when warmer air replaces the colder, it is a warm front,
    and vice-versa.
