term: psychrometer
definition:
  1: An instrument used for measuring the water vapor content of the atmosphere; a
    type of hygrometer; it consists of two thermometers, one of which (the dry bulb)
    is an ordinary glass thermometer, while the other (wet bulb) has its bulb covered
    with a jacket of clean muslin which is saturated with distilled water prior to
    an observation; when the bulbs are suitably ventilated, they indicate the thermodynamic
    wet- and dry-bulb temperatures of the atmosphere; one variety is the assman psychrometer
    (a special form of aspiration psychrometer for which the ventilation is provided
    by a suction fan).
