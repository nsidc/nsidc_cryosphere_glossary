term: microwave sensors
definition:
  1: In terms of wavelength, microwaves range from 1 millimeter to 1 meter, and are
    much longer than the shorter visible (0.38-0.78 micrometer) wavelengths; these
    longer wavelengths allow microwave energy to penetrate through clouds; because
    these sensors measure microwave energy, they do not rely on sunlight for illumination
    so they can acquire images regardless of time of day; can be either passive or
    active; passive sensors detect and record naturally upwelling microwave energy
    emitted from objects; active sensors generate their own beam of energy, generally
    with an antenna, which then detects the returned energy patterns (backscatter)
    that indicate the presence of features and their position relative to the sensor;
    radar (radio detection and ranging) was an original active microwave sensor that
    became widely operational with the onset of world war ii.
