  definition:
    1: |
    Snow bedforms are repeating patterns formed on snow surfaces either by wind erosion
    or deposition of wind transported snow particles.  They are similar to sand dunes and
    other desert landforms caused by wind erosion and deposition of sand; and features
    found on the beds of rivers, shorelines, and on the beds of sandy coastal seas and
    the deep ocean. Snow bedforms range from small pits and ripple marks of a few
    centimeters to Antarctic megadunes.
