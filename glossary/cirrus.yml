term: cirrus
definition:
  1: A principal high-level cloud type (cloud genus), appearing as detached clouds
    in the form of white, delicate filaments or white or mostly white patches or narrow
    bands; these clouds have a fibrous (hair-like) appearance, or a silky sheen, or
    both; because cirrus elements are too narrow, they do not produce a complete circular
    halo.
