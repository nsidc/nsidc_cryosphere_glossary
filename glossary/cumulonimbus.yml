term: cumulonimbus
definition:
  1: A principal cloud type (cloud genus) of vertical development, exceptionally dense
    and vertically developed clouds, occurring either as isolated clouds or as a line
    or wall of clouds with separated upper portions; these clouds appear as mountains
    or huge towers, at least a part of the upper portions of which are usually smooth,
    fibrous, or striated, and almost flattened; this part often spreads out in the
    form of an anvil (incus) or vast plume; under the base of cumulonimbus, which
    is very dark, there frequently exist virga, precipitation, and low, ragged clouds,
    either merged with it or not; its precipitation is often heavy and always of a
    showery nature.
