term: hummock
definition:
  1: '[sea ice] a smooth hill of ice that forms on the sea ice surface from eroding
    ridges, particularly during the summer melt; the formation of hummocks is similar
    to young mountain peaks with steep slopes that erode into smooth, rolling hills.'
  2: '[frozen ground] small lumps of soil pushed up by frost action, often found in
    uniformly spaced in large groups.  hummocks can form in areas of permafrost or
    seasonally frozen ground, and are one of the most common surface features of the
    arctic.'
