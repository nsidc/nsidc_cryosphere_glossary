term: cloud
definition:
  1: A hydrometeor consisting of a visible aggregate of minute particles of liquid
    water or ice, or both, suspended in the free air and usually not touching the
    earth's surface; it may also include larger particles of liquid water or ice (precipitation
    particles) and non-aqueous liquid or solid particles such as those present in
    fumes, smoke and dust (aerosols); cloudiness is the same as cloud cover; but usually
    it is used in a very general sense.
