term: ice prisms
definition:
  1: A fall of unbranched ice crystals, in the form of needles, columns, or plates,
    often so tiny that they seem to be suspended in the air; these are visible mainly
    when they glitter in the sunshine (diamond dust); they may then produce a luminous
    pillar or other halo phenomena; this hydrometeor, which is frequent in polar regions,
    occurs at very low temperatures and in stable air masses.
