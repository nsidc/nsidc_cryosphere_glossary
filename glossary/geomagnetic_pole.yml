term: geomagnetic pole
definition:
  1: 'The point of intersection of the earth''s surface with the axis of a simple
    magnetic dipole that best approximates the earth''s actual, more complex magnetic
    field; if the earth''s magnetic field were a perfect dipole then the field lines
    would be vertical at the geomagnetic poles, and they would therefore coincide
    with the magnetic poles: however, the dipole approximation is in fact far from
    perfect, so in reality the magnetic and geomagnetic poles lie some distance apart.'
