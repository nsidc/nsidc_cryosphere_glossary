term: climate variability
definition:
  1: In the most general sense, the term climate variability denotes the inherent
    characteristic of climate which manifests itself in changes with time; the degree
    of climate variability can be described by the differences between long-term statistics
    of meteorological elements calculated for different periods, (in this sense, the
    measure of climate variability is the same as the measure of climate change).
  2: The term climate variability is often used to denote deviations of climate statistics
    over a given period of time (such as a specific month, season or year) from the
    long-term climate statistics relating to the corresponding calendar period; (in
    this sense, climate variability is measured by those deviations, which are usually
    termed anomalies).
