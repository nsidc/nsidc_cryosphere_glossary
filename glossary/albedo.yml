  1: A non-dimensional, unitless quantity that measures how well a surface reflects
    solar energy; ranges from 0 - 1; a value of 0 means the surface is a perfect absorber,
    where all incoming energy is absorbed, a value of 1 means the surface is a perfect
    reflector, where all incoming energy is reflected and none is absorbed. this quantity
    can also be expressed as a percent with a range from 0 to 100, with zero percent
    absorbing all incoming energy and 100 percent reflecting all energy.
