term: rock flour
definition:
  1: A fine powder of silt- and clay-sized particles that a glacier creates as its
    rock-laden ice scrapes over bedrock; usually flushed out in meltwater streams,
    causing water to look powdery gray; lakes and oceans that fill with glacier flour
    may develop a banded appearance.
