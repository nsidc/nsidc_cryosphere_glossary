  term: barchan dune
  definition:
    1: |
    A barchan dune is a snow bedform.  Barchan dunes are crescent shaped mounds
    with a tail directed upwind and two horns pointing downwind.  Barchans form
    in sand as well as snow.  Snow barchans are typically 3 to 20 m long, 5 to
    12 m wide and 0.1 to 0.5 m high.  Most observations of barchans have been
    reported for Antarctica and Greenland.  They tend to form when new snow is
    transported by moderate winds (8 to 20 m/s).
