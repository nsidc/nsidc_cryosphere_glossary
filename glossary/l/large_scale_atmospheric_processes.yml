term: large-scale atmospheric processes
definition:
  1: Atmospheric processes with a representative scale (large-scale) of 10,000 kilometers
    (6,200 miles); in meteorology, it is a scale in which the curve of the earth is
    not negligible; the large-scale atmospheric flows are essentially nearly hydrostatic,
    nearly geostrophic and wave-like in appearance; they exist mainly in response
    to the latitudinal differences in radiative heating, to the particular value of
    the coriolis force and to the spatial distribution of the oceans and continents.
