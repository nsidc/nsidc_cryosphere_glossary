term: latent heat of fusion
definition:
  1: "The amount of heat required to cause a change of phase from solid to liquid,\
    \ or the heat released when the phase change is from liquid to solid; in the case\
    \ of melting snow, the phase change from ice to water requires a significant amount\
    \ of heat\x97160 times that required to raise the temperature of the same amount\
    \ of ice by just 1 degree celsius; until the required amount of heat is supplied\
    \ to completely melt all of the ice being considered, no further increase in temperature\
    \ will occur."
