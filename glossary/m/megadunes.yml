term: megadunes
definition:
  1: Unlike snow dunes that are piles of drifted snow, antarctic megadunes are long,
    undulating waves in the surface of the ice sheet that are 2 to 4 meters (6.5 to
    13 feet) high and 2 to 5 kilometers (1 to 3 miles) apart; they are slightly rounded
    at their crests and are so subtle that a person on the ground cannot see the pattern.
