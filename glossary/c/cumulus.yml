term: cumulus
definition:
  1: A principal low-level cloud type (cloud genus) in the form of individual, detached
    elements which are generally dense and possess sharp non-fibrous outlines; these
    elements develop vertically, appearing as rising mounds, domes, or towers, the
    upper parts of which often resembles a cauliflower; the sunlit parts of these
    clouds are mostly brilliant white; their bases are relatively dark and nearly
    horizontal; near the horizon the vertical development of cumulus often causes
    the individual clouds to appear merged; if precipitation occurs, it is usually
    of a showery nature.
