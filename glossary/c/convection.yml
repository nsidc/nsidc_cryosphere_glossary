term: convection
definition:
  1: The transport of energy resulting from the concerted movement of molecules in
    coherent groups; contrasts with conduction in which energy is transported by the
    random motions of molecules; atmospheric convection is nearly always turbulent
    and results in the vertical transport and mixing of atmospheric properties.
