term: cold glacier
definition:
  1: Glacier in which most of the ice is below the pressure melting point; nonetheless,
    the glacier's surface may be susceptible to melt due to incoming solar radiation,
    and the ice at the rock/ice interface may be warmed as a result of the natural
    (geothermal) heat from the earth's surface.
