term: flooded sea ice
definition:
  1: Ice that is pushed into the underlying ocean water by the weight of thick snow
    cover on its surface; the salty ocean water floods the snow cover and creates
    a salty, slushy layer; flooded sea ice is more common in the antarctic because
    of more snowfall and thinner sea ice than in the arctic.
