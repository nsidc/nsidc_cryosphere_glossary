term: tropopause
definition:
  1: The boundary layer between the troposphere and stratosphere, where an abrupt
    change in temperature lapse rate usually occurs; it is defined as the lowest level
    at which the lapse rate decreases to 2 degrees celsius per kilometer or less,
    provided that the average lapse rate between this level and all higher levels
    within 2 kilometers does not exceed 2 degrees celsius per kilometer; occasionally,
    a second tropopause may be found if the lapse rate above the first tropopause
    exceeds 3 degrees celsius per kilometer.
