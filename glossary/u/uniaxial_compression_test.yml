term: uniaxial compression test
definition:
  1: A method to determine the short-term strength of rocks; conducted by employing
    a constant loading rate until failure; the failure load is used to calculate the
    failure stress; can also be used to determine the elastic constants of rocks (i.e.
    young's modulus, poisson's ratio).
