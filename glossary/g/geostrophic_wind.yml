term: geostrophic wind
definition:
  1: Theoretical wind which results from the equilibrium between horizontal components
    of the pressure gradient force and the coriolis force (deviating force) above
    the friction layer; only these two forces (no frictional force) are supposed to
    act on the moving air; it blows parallel to straight isobars or contours.
