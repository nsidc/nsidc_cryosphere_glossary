term: North Atlantic Oscillation
definition:
  1: An oscillation in the strength of the icelandic low and azores high, the two
    dominant surface pressure features in the north atlantic. when both are unusually
    strong, the north atlantic oscillation (nao) is in its positive phase; when both
    are unusually weak, it is in its negative phase. the nao has climate impacts not
    just in the arctic, but in north america and europe. the nao, identified by sir
    gilbert walker in the 1920s, is similar to the arctic oscillation.
