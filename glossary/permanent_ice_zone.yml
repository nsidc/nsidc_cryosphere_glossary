term: permanent ice zone
definition:
  1: A region that is covered with sea ice year-round; most of the sea ice in the
    permanent ice zone is multiyear ice, but younger ice and open water may still
    be present; the permanent ice zone is what remains in summer after all melting
    has occurred (often called the summer minimum extent).
