    Satrugi are erosional snow bedforms.  They are formed when wind-entrained
    particles carve hardened, wind-packed snow on sea ice, glaciers and land.
    Sastrugi are aligned parallel to the prevailing wind direction have steep
    slopes facing the wind and gentle slopes that stretch downwind.
    These features have been used to map wind directions in Antartica.
    Intersection of satrugi create sharp edges that appear as grooves,
    scallops and flutes.  Typically, satrugi are between 0.3 and 0.5 m
    high.  Similar features are found in warm deserts, where they are
    are caled "yardangs".
