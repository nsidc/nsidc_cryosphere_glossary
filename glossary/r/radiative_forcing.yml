term: radiative forcing
definition:
  1: A measure of the additional absorption of solar radiation from light absorbing
    particles (lap) such as dust or soot. units of measure are watts per square meter
    (w/m2) and values can range from 0 to 500 w/m2. the maximum value depends on incoming
    solar radiation (elevation, direct sun vs shaded) and the amount of dust or soot.
    a value of 0 means no additional radiation is being absorbed. a value of 500 means
    nearly all of the solar energy is absorbed (depends on latitude, elevation, clouds).
    radiative forcing is calculated by the difference between the net (downward minus
    upward) radiative fluxes (irradiance) with and without lap.
