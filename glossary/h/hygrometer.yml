term: hygrometer
definition:
  1: 'An instrument which measures the water vapor content in the atmosphere; there

    hence various types of hygrometers; these are: a) the psychrometer, which utilizes
    the thermodynamic method; b) the class of instruments which depends upon a change
    of physical dimension due to absorption of moisture (hair hygrometer, for example);
    c) those which depend upon condensation of moisture (dew point hygrometer); d)
    the class of instruments which depend upon the change of chemical or electrical
    properties due to absorption of moisture, and some others.'
